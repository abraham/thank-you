  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Thank You we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can't stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
    <li>We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
    <li>We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
    <!-- <li>In our blogging products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.</li> -->
  </ul>
  <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals: (Note, we've modified <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/">Automattic's privacy policy</a> available under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Sharealike</a> license.)</p>
  <!-- <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact our <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/">support team</a>.</p> -->
  <p>Thank You operates <a href="https://thankyou.delivery/">thankyou.delivery</a>. It is Thank You’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

  <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
  <p>Like most website operators, Thank You collects non-personally identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Thank You's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Thank You's visitors use its websites. From time to time, Thank You may release non-personally identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its websites.</p>
  <p>Thank You also collects potentially personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving Thanks. Thank You only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally identifying information as described below.</p>

  <h3>Gathering of Personally Identifying Information</h3>
  <p>Certain visitors to Thank You’s websites choose to interact with Thank You in ways that require Thank You to gather personally identifying information. The amount and type of information that Thank You gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to provide Twitter profile information such as username and email address. In each case, Thank You collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Thank You. Thank You does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

  <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
  <p>Thank You may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Thank You may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Thank You does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below.</p>

  <h3>Protection of Certain Personally Identifying Information</h3>
  <p>Thank You discloses potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Thank You’s behalf or to provide services available at Thank You’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Thank You’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Thank You will not rent or sell potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Thank You discloses potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Thank You believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Thank You, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Thank You website and have supplied your email address, Thank You may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Thank You and our products. We primarily use our websites to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Thank You takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information.</p>

  <h3>Cookies</h3>
  <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Thank You uses cookies to help Thank You identify and track visitors, their usage of Thank You websites, and their websites access preferences. Thank You visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Thank You’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Thank You’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

  <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
  <p>If Thank You, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Thank You goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Thank You may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

  <h3>Ads</h3>
  <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Thank You and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

  <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
  <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Thank You may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Thank You’s sole discretion. Thank You encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have an account, you should also check your personal dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
